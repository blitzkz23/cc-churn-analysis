# Credit Card Churn Analysis with ETL
This project are BTPN Syariah Data Engineer Final Project for Virtual Internship Program on Rakamin Academy, activities conducted in this project are:
- ETL Process with SSIS
- Data Modelling for Data Warehouse
- Data Analysis with SQL Server

# Problem Statements
A certain bank is troubled by the increasing number of customers who are attriting and leaving their credit card services. To mitigate this issue, the bank intends to conduct data analysis on their customer's historical data to identify the reasons for the churn and determine the factors and attributes that may have contributed to it. This will help the bank to improve their services and retain their customers by addressing the underlying issues.

# Business Objective
From the problem statements above, as a data engineer here are some objective that I've proposed for this project:
- Build data pipeline from available dataset into a data warehouse
- Conduct an analysis in order to determine factors and attributes that may have contributed to the service churn
- Give insight presentation in the form of data visualization in order to make it easy for user to understand the data
